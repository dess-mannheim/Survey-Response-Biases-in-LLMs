    "In this notebook I set up the perturbation experiments for meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct. First, the general infrastructure for interacting with meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct is set up. Second, the prompt is designed as well as the iterative API requests to Huggingface to generate the answers to the according questions and answer options. In a third and last step, the answers of the model are stored in a dataframe for further analysis."
