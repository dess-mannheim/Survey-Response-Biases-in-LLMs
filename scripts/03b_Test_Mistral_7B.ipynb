    "In this notebook I set up the perturbation experiments for Mistral. First, the general infrastructure for interacting with Mistral is set up. Second, the prompt is designed as well as the iterative API requests to Huggingface to generate the answers to the according questions and answer options. In a third and last step, the answers of the model are stored in a dataframe for further analysis."
